# Synthesis

Execution engine for the Tekton project ecosystem.

## Overview

Synthesis is the execution component of the Tekton ecosystem. It takes plans created by Prometheus and implements them in a structured, phase-based approach, culminating in complete solutions.

## Features

- **Phase-Based Execution**: Breaks complex plans into logical phases
- **Step-by-Step Implementation**: Executes each phase as discrete, manageable steps
- **Component Integration**: Assembles partial solutions into cohesive wholes
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors execution status with detailed logging
- **Adaptive Execution**: Adjusts implementation based on feedback and environmental changes

## Integration

Synthesis works closely with:
- **Prometheus**: Receives execution plans and reports progress
- **Ergon**: Utilizes agents for specific execution tasks
- **Codex**: Employs code generation and management capabilities
- **Engram**: Accesses memory for context-aware execution
